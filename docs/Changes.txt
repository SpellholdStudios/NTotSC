Patching DVs for all creatures must be done through WRITE_ASCII, not SAY (!).

NTBALEN   - changed "Unknown" animation to "FIGHTER_MALE_HUMAN"

NTDXTER   - changed alignment to NEUTRAL_EVIL since "LAWFULL_GOOD" really didn't make any sense. This way, at least paladins can get a heads up.

NTGHELDE  - changed "Unknown" animation to "FIGHTER_MALE_GNOME"

NTKOLDAR  - changed "Unknown" animation to "FIGHTER_MALE_HUMAN"

NTKrotan  - changed non-game script to "WTASIGHT"

NTMARIEL  - deleted nonexistant item "ROGUE.ITM", changed "Unknown" animation to Thief_female_human

NTMORDOR  - changed AX1H06.itm (special item in BG:EE) to AX1H05.itm (general throwing ax +2)

NTNIMFUR  - added DV "ntnimfur" and changed class to "Fighter" (because she will fight back)

NTOGREDA  - changed non-game script "BPWTSIGT.bcs" to "WTASIGHT"; changed unique game item "Flame of the North" ("SW2H12") to generic two-handed sword +2 (SW2H11.itm)

NTSILUA   - changed name to "Sirene" (stringref. of game, same for BG:EE) to remove doubled "Sil" in game

ntslavex  - (Fisherman): dialogue "ntslavex" with random lines added.

NTSVLAST  - removed SHOUT (because it doesn't make sense he would shout if he wants the PC to kill him) and changed Default script to WTASIGHT.bcs (removed the random-walk)

NTTYTUS   - changed non-game ressource "SWANARM.itm" to "PLAT14" for BGT/EET and "PLAT06" for BG:EE. Changed "BELT08" to "BELT07" for BG:EE

NTABIGAI.d: changed dialogue trigger from "True()" to newly introduced check variable "!Global("NT_CitadelHostile","GLOBAL",1)" and added dialogue state in case PC attacked the citadel

NTKOLDAR.d: added reveal of area of Fields of the dead (AR10PB.are)

NTKROTAN.d etc.: fixed wrong transitions before the final fight (Eldod leaving instead of staying, Eldod not turning hostile). Also, all of the three mercenaries will turn hostile as stated in the journal entry.

NTLLINDE.d: moved into folder /llindellyn. unified Llindellyn's name to "Llindellyn".

NTMAGDAD.d, NTWILLORM.d: unified tracking variable for quest "Save Magnad's and winorma's Children". The relatives now react to the death of other family members.

NTMEANDA.d: When Meander mentions the Field of the Dead, the area will be revealed on the worldmap as well. Added one reply line for reluctant PC (flow of dialogue states is not changed), added intermediate dialogue states to prevent "has nothing to say to you" between quests

NTMILEA.d: removed wrong journal entry (was for Paulina)

NTORPEHO.d: added ActionOverride for Brentaw to attack Orpeho, too

NTOUPAST.d: changed Oupaste's dialogue so he can be talked to indefinitely times until he was asked about the book of the unknowing, and also disabled the question in case the PC already found the book.

NTSZYPER.d: added Dead("NTSILUA") check since the sirenes were supposed to be killed, too.

NTSVLAST.d: activated the hostile response if attacked

NTTORDIO.d: added BGII item "MISCAU" as possible holy water for the quest with the haunting spirit. The Phantom Torqion in Temple area dungeon can now be released using the Vampiric Sword of the mod The Vault, too. considers holy water from both BGT/EET version and BG:EE version of DSotSC.

WENRIC.d: introduced WEIGHT and removed extra state trigger for state 5 + extra "always true" dialogue - not necessary and bad for compatibility



ar0114.baf: oupaste is spawned from the beginning so the player already met him and doesn't have to search in places he already was.

ar0020.baf : the candle for Ordolath will now be created in "Container 2" (shelf) instead of locked and warded chest (it doesn't make sense that hostile mage will call the guards)

ar0800.baf: removed NTHASDAR.cre's spawn (is moved into ar1300.baf). Removed spawn of NTSHAELL.cre (original game Shaella will be used now, no more doubled Shaella).

ar35pb.baf: added "!Dead("NTKROTAN")" check so the murder of Utor won't happen after Krotan is defeated. Added DestroySelf() to Brenta in case he is still there after Krotan is defeated

ar4500.baf: changed entrance to dungeon in Firewine bridge  (quest by Charleston Nib) to a script/entrance combo (PC sees the entrance but can't enter without the scroll) (nttr50pb.baf is script of "entrance")

cutrest.baf: changed so it actually rests and heals the group.

6) Stores.
STHAEBAL.sto: references of DSotSC-items removed, will be inserted if install of DSotSC is detected. References of BGII scrolls removed, will be inserted for BGT/EET install.



7) General things.

-opened transition to AR80PB (Pass to the cave with the book of the unknowing) from the start.

-added script block to Tracea (cult in Ulgoth's Beard) that adds a note in case Reedrig was killed before he could reveal AR60PB.are (only in this case).
Added the same note to Reedrig if spawned in Ulgoth's Beard - the player will only find one note. Added script block to ar1000.are (Ulgoth's Beard) to reveal the AR60PB.are and journal entry in case player has the note.

-ntprihel: changed store to a custom store with one scroll of lesser restoration and holy water. removed restriction of "spoke to Satos" before temple services can be requested.

-moved journal entry about "no warm welcome" from the guard to Eldod's first line.

-patched AR0602.bcs for BGT so journal entries get removed upon transitiont to BGII

-Northern Citadel quest: the quest itself is less restrictive, i.e. Eldo can be freed and Krotan confronted without talking to anyone else (including Satos) if the PC knows how. Pique will talk to the PC either after talking to Lenore OR after Eldod moved into his room. If PC confronts Krotan before talking to Shelton, Orpeho will participate in the confrontation and not kill Utor (+ not fight with Brentaw).

-added citadel-script(s) to all inhabitants of the Northern Citadel to detect an PC attack.

-except Utor, Abigail and the Cook, none of the Citadel cres will give rep loss if killed

-Nim Furlwing's Hunting Hounds: changed to custom vampiric wolves (NTWOLFVA) that will only attack if PC is present and primarily the hounds, reduced the number of vampiric wolves to 3. ("ntwolfva.bcs", and changed fighting script of the dogs NTDOGFUN.cre to a custom script "ntdogfu2.baf" so the dogs don't kill the wolves before the PC reaches the scene.)

-added random lines to DSotSC's Woodelves to prevent the "has nothing to say to you": ntwdelf.tra

-inserted ntpblet5.itm: a note from Draagis to Haeball about the dagger and the ring (placed into Haeball's locked desk in AR9001.are)

-BGII- and / or DSotSC items are inserted into the areas via script if game/mod is detcted
