@0    = ~I have little patience for these paltry pleasantries, but we should know whom we are to fight beside. I am Kamira, and a more competent blade you will not find this side of Waterdeep. I have been paid well to be here, but the sooner we are done, the better. It is likely but a wild dog or some such that plagues these foolish monks. I prefer more challenging circumstances. Life is made fun by crushing your enemies.~
@1    = ~It is a good time for us to go our separate ways. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
// #3369
@2    = ~Kobalds? So few would never come this close to a fortified keep.  They've not the stomach for overwhelming odds. Strange...~
@3    = ~That was an ogre! They were talking about a mausoleum! We'll meet there!~
// #3368
@4    = ~Flattery will get you nowhere.~
